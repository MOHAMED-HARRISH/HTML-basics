    <div id="div3"><p>Cats are highly intelligent 
        creatures that have been associated with humans
         for over 9,500 years. They are carnivores and extremely skilled hunters â€“ they are known to hunt over 1,000 different species of animal. Keep reading for more
         information and facts about cats.</p>
        <p>The cat from the family Felis catus is a carnivorous mammal that has become a domesticated species.
            Within the family Felidae it is the only domesticated species and is referred to as a domesticated cat to separate it from other members of wild cat in the family.
            A cat can either be a house (domestic) cat, a farm cat, or a feral cat.
            Domestic cats are valued by humans for their ability to kill rodents (farm cats) as well as for companionship (house cats).
            Feral cats range freely and avoid human contact. They can be destructive to habitats by killing birds, rodents, and reptiles.</p>
        <p>It is noteworthy that the ancestors of the other common household pet, the dog, were social animals that lived together in packs in which there was subordination to a leader, and the dog has readily transferred its allegiance from pack leader to human master. The cat, however, has not yielded as readily to subjugation. Consequently, the house cat is able to revert to complete self-reliance more quickly and more successfully than most domesticated dogs. For an account of the relationship of the family
             of cats to other carnivores, see carnivore.</p></div>
